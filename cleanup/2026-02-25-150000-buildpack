### [Effortless Containerization with Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://confoo.ca/en/2026/session/effortless-containerization-with-cloud-native-buildpacks)

Generate container images without writing a Dockerfile — standardized, language-agnostic containerization.

---

#### What are Buildpacks?

- Automatically detect and build your app into an OCI-compliant container image
- Language-agnostic: same process regardless of stack
- **Paketo** is a popular open-source implementation — see [`paketo-buildpacks/samples`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples)
- Can install additional OS libraries via `apt` on the resulting image

---

#### Adoption Checklist

- Which languages/runtimes are supported by the chosen buildpack?
- Which **builder** to use? (base image + bundled buildpacks)
- Any extra OS packages needed?
- Custom CA certificates required?

---

#### CI/CD Integration

- CLI tool: `pack` for local builds and scripting
- CircleCI has native buildpack support
- The builder image can be referenced directly as the CI runner image
